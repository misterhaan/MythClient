# MythClient
MythClient helps Windows clients play recordings from a separate MythTV server.  It provides an alternative to the MythWeb Recorded Programs page, with the streaming and downloading of recordings replaced with directly launching the recording from a network share.

Download the latest installer from [track7.org](http://www.track7.org/code/vs/mythclient).  Check the [wiki](https://github.com/misterhaan/MythClient/wiki/) for more information.
